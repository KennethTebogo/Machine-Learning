# Overview
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). This project shows how to implement linear regression from scratch, as well as how to use Scikit-learn's built-in linear regression model.

# Project Setup
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

# Python 3.x
NumPy: For numerical computations
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation
Matplotlib (optional): For visualization

# Installation
You can install all the required dependencies using a requirements.txt file that includes the following:

nginx

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
```

To install them, simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone the Repository
To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KennethTebogo/linear-regression.git
```

cd linear-regression

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the linear regression model contains multiple features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable). You can replace the dataset in the data.csv file with your own dataset as long as it follows the required format.

The dataset might look like:

Feature 1	Feature 2	Target
1.1	2.3	4.4
2.5	3.7	7.5
3.2	1.9	5.3
...	...	...
The dataset should be structured in a CSV format where the first row contains column names.

# Usage
Linear Regression from Scratch
The project provides an implementation of linear regression from scratch, which allows you to understand the underlying principles of the algorithm. The model is trained using a cost function (Mean Squared Error) and optimized with gradient descent.

Using Scikit-learn's Linear Regression

Alternatively, you can use Scikit-learn's built-in linear regression model to quickly and easily train a model on your data. Scikit-learn handles the internal optimization and evaluation processes, simplifying the machine learning workflow.

# Model Evaluation
Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.

R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model. R² values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.

These evaluation metrics will help you assess how well the model is performing and whether any further improvements or fine-tuning are necessary.
